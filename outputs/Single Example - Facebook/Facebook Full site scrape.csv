"Feb 6, 2017",5.0,"I absolutely loved my time at Facebook. I was lucky enough to work with talented, passionate, knowledgeable people who were super supportive and friendly. You're positively encouraged to express your ideas and trusted to work autonomously. The work is challenging and interesting and the social aspect is great too; there's always something to get involved with should you want to. They provide free breakfast, lunch... and dinner which is pretty amazing. Despite contracts running 11 months (which sucks) they actively stay in contact / try and find way of getting great people to stay / come back. The hours are long - but  no longer than any other job I've had in London and the rewards and job satisfaction are well worth it.","Hard for me to find any cons, but if pushed would say lack of headcount.",922,2017,2017-02-06

Employees are empowered to build anything, any app, service, feature. If you are a big fan of autonomy and self-driven growth, Facebook is the place to go.

Managers don't bark orders or give commands, but spend the vast majority of their time as a support role, and encouraging leadership between engineers.","Can be intimidating at times, and coworkers definitely work a lot. Perhaps similarly to startups where everyone is motivated.

Value: Done is better than perfect - the incorrect interpretation is that done and perfect are mutually exclusive, no-one wants to do anything that is perfect.
Value: We [managers / leaders] are non-directive - incorrect interpretation is that managers do not need to provide direction, the result is that manager are ineffective and simply try to please... employees.
Value: Make an impact - incorrect interpretation is any impact is a good impact, the actual impact of this is that there is little significant impact.

The company has many conflicting ways of working, for example the short term review process and the want and need to take risks and innovate.  The result is that employees do not want to take long term risks as they will be penalised in their next review.

There is a PIP (personal improvement plan) process to help those underachieving to get back on track.  This is only effective at removing people from the company and during new manager training (FME) managers are informed that most people (>80%) that are placed on a PIP leave the company.  At the same time the company prides itself on the ability of employees to have tough conversations (Crucial Conversations is a class employees are encouraged to attend) yet no-one has these tough conversations.

All the free food, snacks, drinks etc. are made to keep you at work longer :)","Looking back at my experience there, I can clearly see that I was unfortunate to end up in a team that I was in. The fact that no one internally wanted to move to that team should have alarmed me, but having just moved to FB I didn’t think of leaving that early. Internally, people were very open about how they would rather quit than join our team. I figured that’s the reason why they hired a complete new team,... instead of just moving some people around. 
 
However, people at FB are generally blinded by the perks and the status of the company.  They make themselves believe that they are happy, but in reality everyone is constantly anxious. They just learn to cope and make it feel normal. 

The pressure is HIGH and the workload tremendous. Because of the amount of silly meetings that you can’t say no to, you will end up spending more than 50 hours per week to make sure you are up to speed. Some people at FB told me that work consumed every second of their life (they just couldn’t switch off). I knew of other colleages that they come in on a Saturday to do some extra work, and some dedicate their Sunday evening on projects to add to their internal CV. 
You can’t really switch off, at least not before 9PM. So, if you’re in a relationship/have kids, don’t go there. As a single person I felt bad for my colleagues with a family.

In my situation, and I also speak for the rest of the team, there was no support, no proper internal onboarding and literally no one around to be able to inform you what the general expectations were. It’s all very performance driven, so you have to Build up that amount of work you do, cause everything gets tracked. They don’t care how you do it, just do it. This explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts. You will be compared to Peers on your level, so it’s important to make sure you hit at least average to receive some bonus after your review. 

We had a new manager starting a few months after us, and hierarchy was the management style. Having anything to say went against the manager’s principles and clearly we weren’t liked. So were other colleagues of other teams not liked by this manager, because of their opinions. Be mindful of what you say...not everything is appreciated. 
At FB, managers are more valued than IC’s and they rather keep a bad manager than a good IC. So please be careful and try to make your manager your friend, trust me it will help you. 

They have amazing trainings on how to manage bias, but in all honesty, everyone was biased. The way they hired people, they way they treated people and the way they rated each other. During the annual performance cycle, you would only ask feedback from the people you had a good relationship with to help you get your bonus. 

Up until now, FB was the least favorable experience for me. I only say ‘worst experience’ when I talk to friends. They saw the negative impact it had on me working in a toxic environment. 

I do want to say that 2% genuinely loves working there, unfortunately the majority doesn’t.",973,2018,2018-12-04

"Jul 18, 2019",3.0,"Generally speaking you are treated well, it really depends on the team you work within. There is a lot of negative press on the outside about FB but on the inside you witness all of the good FB does. If you align to what they are doing it gives you a great feeling.

Free food 
Again depending on team, very casual about where and when for working","Some management have got to where they are from longevity within the business and not the impact they have which hinders people 

The review process is pretty rough, bottom line is if you don't get on with your manager you are not going to get very far in your career, a lot of bias in this process. 

They talk a lot about an open feedback company and how everyone is honest which is fair but when management can't... take feedback or literally do not care  then that is the issue 

Most managers are very disconnected from the recruiting process and try to dictate what you should do when generally you will know what is best for your clients",991,2019,2019-07-18

Very big and cool issues to work on, which you wouldn't fine any where else in the world due to the sheer scale of the company.","The internal career system seems well intended and fair at first, until you try to follow it.
Very poor work-life balance. I've never worked so much in my entire career, yet it never seems enough to satisfy the criteria to grow up internally.

All internal systems are custom made and many times they compare poorly to open-source alternatives, specially from usability and stability perspective. Which means you... will spend a long time to master the internal tooling and all that hard-earned knowledge will be worthless when you leave the company.
Also, that all engineers have so much freedom means that everyone is constantly reinventing the wheel, and increasing the overall complexity of the environment thus changes harder and harder as time goes by.
This is exacerbated by the bonus system,  which for many years has encouraged engineers to build and deliver new things rather than fixing existing issues.

All of this combined has lead to a monstrous internal ecosystem which is a huge pile of entangled hair, where the simplest of tasks requires careful planning and understanding and will take several days.

Management has lately changed the incentives to encourage fixing and better quality, but it's too little too late.",997,2019,2019-07-21

* Very individualistic mindset, team is only the logo on the swag you get.
* Several years of unattended spaghetti engineering that nobody dares to handle, but someone has to maintain (and get burnt doing so). 
* Awful oncalls due to the horrible engineering practices and mountains of tech debt.
* Blame showers during incident reviews (and incident triaging)....
* Over the fence handovers. Fake promises by recruiters, lack of leadership.
* Walls between orgs for transfers and artificial, per-org devopment limitations. It's better to leave and reinterview with a chance of getting better offer than trying to move internally (and still going through the interviews) and getting your level frozen for a year.

There's some efforts to improve engineering practices, but get smudged and diluted by the lack of will and understanding from the leadership, and the lack of reward from the global org (doing two really crappy things gives you more performance review points than doing something with high quality, and/or refactoring any amount of the crappy things around).",1005,2019,2019-08-15
